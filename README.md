## Introduction

This is a Go-based Product Management API that provides functionality for managing products in an inventory system. Version 2.0 introduces rate limiting to prevent excessive API requests. It supports the following operations:

- Get all products
- Get product by ID
- Add a new product
- Update product details
- Delete a product

## New Features in Version 2.0

- **Rate Limiting**: This version includes rate limiting to ensure fair usage of the API. Requests will be limited to a specified number per minute to prevent overloading the system.
